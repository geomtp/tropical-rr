I would also like to express my gratitude to 
many colleagues through my master's 
and doctoral programs, 
everyone in the same student office, 
and everyone in the same laboratory 
who have helped me enormously.
I would like to thank  everyone
I met at the workshops for tropical geometry
have served as a significant motivation 
for my research.
Lastly, I want to express special thanks to
my family who have supported me both mentally
